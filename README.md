# Configuration System

Brain Shell includes a configuration deployment system.

Structure:

```text
configs/
├── hypr/
│   └── hyprland.lua
│
├── Brain_Shell/
│   ├── Brain_ShellKeybinds.lua
│   ├── Brain_ShellKeybinds.conf
│   └── colors.conf
│
└── systemd/
    └── brainshell.service
```

The installer deploys:

```text
~/.config/
├── hypr/
├── Brain_Shell/
└── systemd/user/
```

---

# Backup System

Before modifying existing configurations, Brain Shell creates a backup:

```text

```

This allows restoring the previous Hyprland configuration if needed.
